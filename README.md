Scope: Covered language processing, including splitting text into tokens, syntax validation, and code execution
• Lexical Analyzer: Tokenized input to identify elements such as keywords and operators, ensuring proper categorization
for the next stages
• Parser: Used EBNF to define grammar rules and build a syntax tree. Implemented syntax and runtime error checking
• Interpreter: Executed the parsed code by translating the syntax tree. Handled run-time errors, such as type mismatches
or undefined variables, to ensure smooth code execution
